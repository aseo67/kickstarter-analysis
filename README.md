# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Background/Purpose
In preparation of the new play _Fever_, the playwright, Louise, currently estimates a needed budget of over $10,000. Prior to launching a crowdfunding campaign to help fund this budget, Louise would like to gain insight into how she can execute a successful campaign. This analysis explores historical Kickstarter campaigns and what factors drive those that have succeeded in reaching their goal. With these insights, Louise can determine the best path forward for her play's campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Data organization challenges
"launched_at" and "deadline" dates provided in unix time code (needed conversion); solution - conversion in columns S and T of data table, further organized into Year (of launch) in column U
combined category and subcategory data in single cell; solution - split into separate columns in columns Q and R, for easier filtering and analysis at parent-category level (i.e. theater overall)
some theater campaigns were still live (data isn't "final" for us to analyze); solution - has been filtered out of tables/charts; for visual clarity of outcomes, color coding has been applied (green for success, blue for live, red for failed, yellow for canceled)

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
